I am a full stack developer. I prefer to work on interesting problems irrespective of the programming language being used. I strongly believe, every problem can be solved if we concentrate on the “why” part of it, rather than the “how” part of it.


The realisation that we won’t live long enough to, make all the mistakes ourselves has motivated me to learn from the mistakes of others along with mine.


While AFK, I prefer to travel with my camera in search of fantastic places and frames.
